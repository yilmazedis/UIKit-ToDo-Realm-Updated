### Structure
- I used MVC as default design pattern
- I devided Constants, Extension, Enumeration, protocols as much as possible.
- I added an appropriate Logger
- I devided groups with related files.
- I added search bar to find desire task easy.
- I added case diacritic sensitive filter to search bar.
- I added comment as much as possible, rather I prefered well designed function and property names.
- I foced CRUD with protocol
- I used Realm as persistent database
- I try to avoid retain cycle, and cared variables reference count.
- I try to avoid massive ViewController. So, I devided function with related extensions.
- I try to make simple UI as much as possible.
- I didnâ€™t add any UI or UT tests
- Finally, I added two demo to demonstrate my work. ->
